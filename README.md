I am a software developer passionate about turning ideas into incredible and innovative solutions. Currently, I work as a freelancer (PJ) and I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Centro Universit√°rio Bar√£o de Mau√°.

With over 2 years of experience in the field, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work on various interesting projects and explore different languages, libraries, and frameworks. Among my favorites are React/NextJS and Strapi.

I am always seeking knowledge and staying up-to-date to enhance my abilities. If you‚Äôd like to exchange ideas, collaborate on projects, or simply chat about technology, feel free to reach out! üëã

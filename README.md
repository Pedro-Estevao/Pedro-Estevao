I am a software developer passionate about turning ideas into incredible and innovative solutions. Currently, I work as a freelancer (PJ) and I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Centro UniversitÃ¡rio BarÃ£o de MauÃ¡.

With over 2 years of experience in the field, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on various interesting projects and explore different languages, libraries, and frameworks. Among my favorites are React/NextJS and Strapi.

I am always seeking knowledge and staying up-to-date to enhance my abilities. If youâ€™d like to exchange ideas, collaborate on projects, or simply chat about technology, feel free to reach out! ðŸ‘‹
